1. Download / Install Docker
2. `docker run hello-world`
3. `docker run ubuntu`
3. Let's build a Dockerfile!
4. Let's run our first custom made container!


- Images as Layers.  They get smooshed together
- Your local machine is a mess.  Versions, libraries, runtimes....
- Docker lets you ship your app in a pristine stat with ONLY the stuff it needs.
- Once it's packaged up, all it needs to run is Docker.  NOTHING else.
- Vocab:
  * Image
  * Container
  * Dockerfile
